## Can I explain what my code does?

The code I developed is a basic HTML resume for Jaskomal Kaur. The primary functionality of the code is to display a well-structured and accessible resume. The resume includes several key sections:
- **Header**: Displays the name and a brief description of the role.
- **Contact Section**: Includes contact information with a profile picture, email, phone number, and links to GitHub.
- **About Section**: Provides a brief introduction and summary of my design philosophy.
- **Skills Section**: Lists my skills and includes an SVG icon to visually represent UI/UX design principles.
- **Experience Section**: Outlines my current job role and responsibilities.
- **Education Section**: Details my educational background and relevant coursework.
- **Footer**: Contains copyright information and links to LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

The HTML elements are organized semantically, using `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to ensure a clear structure. Each section is identified with unique IDs for better accessibility and navigation.

## What was my coding process?

My approach to this project involved the following steps:
1. **Planning**: I outlined the structure and content of the resume, determining which sections were necessary and how they should be presented.
2. **Setup**: I created a basic HTML template with a `<header>`, `<body>`, and `<footer>`. I also planned where each section would go.
3. **Implementation**: I wrote HTML for each section, ensuring to use semantic elements and include relevant content. I also added accessibility features such as ARIA roles and descriptive alt texts.
4. **Testing and Debugging**: I tested the HTML file in a browser to ensure it rendered correctly and validated the code to check for errors. I fixed issues related to tag structure and image paths.
5. **Reflection**: I reviewed my work to ensure it met the project’s objectives and incorporated feedback where necessary.

## What challenges did I have?

One of the main challenges was ensuring that all HTML tags were correctly nested and that there were no stray or overlapping tags. This required careful attention to detail and multiple rounds of validation. Additionally, handling the image paths was tricky because local paths are not suitable for all environments. I resolved this by using placeholder paths and ensuring they were updated with correct paths before final submission.

Another challenge was implementing accessibility features effectively. I had to ensure that all elements were properly described and navigable using assistive technologies. This required a solid understanding of ARIA roles and attributes.

## What would I do differently now?

Given what I’ve learned, I would:
1. **Improve Planning**: Spend more time in the planning phase to better organize the content and structure before diving into coding. This would include a more detailed outline and wireframes if applicable.
2. **Use CSS for Styling**: While the project requirements specified no CSS, using CSS would enhance the visual design and layout. I would incorporate CSS to improve styling and responsiveness.
3. **Optimize Images**: Ensure that image paths are relative or hosted online, rather than using local paths, to make the project more portable and accessible.
4. **Expand Accessibility Features**: Further explore and implement advanced accessibility features to make the resume usable for all users, including those with disabilities.
